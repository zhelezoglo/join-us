# Simple mobile data visualization app

**Build a small mobile app that**
- pulls in the two small data sets in the `data` folder (`cost.json` and `revenue.json`) of this repo via an HTTP request
- joins the two datasets into one
- adds an additional computed column `profit = revenue - costs` to the dataset
- has one "page" showing a table with the data (ideally sortable by any column)
- has one "page" displaying a line chart with the data (ideally using d3)
- has some test coverage
